- Scrap pieces/sheets of paper
- Sponge
- Scissors

### Instructions
##### Step 1 - Set Up
- Fill 1/3 of your basin tub with water
- Fill 3/4 of your bucket/bowl with water
- Place the mould with the screen side facing up
- Put the deckle ontop of the mould centered
- Lay out a towel on a flat surface

##### Step 2 - Preparing The Paper
- Using a pair of scissors, cut up paper into 1cm x 1cm squares
  - Note that the smaller the squares, the smoother the paper will be
- Submerge the scraps of paper in the bucket/bowl for 3 to 12 hours

##### Step 3 - Pulp Making
- Fill a blender with water
- Put around 1/2 cup of the paper into the blender
- Blend until its consistency turns slush like
- Pour the blended pulp into the basin
- Repeat this step until all of the paper is blended

##### Step 4 - Sheet Formation
- Hold the mould and deckle together with the deckle ontop
- Dip them into the tub at an 45 degree angle
  - Note to use a smaller angle for steeper basins
- Slowly slide the mould and deckle to the bottom of the tub
- Scoop upwards holding the mould and deckle horizontally
- Lightly shake it left to right, and front to back to evenly distribute the pulp
- Let some but not all of the water drain

##### Step 5 - Couching
- Remove the deckle
- In a swift swoop, put the mould facing down on towel
- Press down lightly
- Slowly lift the mould back up

##### Step 6 - Pressing
- Put a paper towel ontop of the couched sheet
- Using a sponge, press gently
- Slowly increase the force with which you press down on the sponge
- Put the sponge aside
- Use a rolling pin to press the paper firmly

##### Step 7 - Drying
- Lay your sheets of paper flat on a smooth flat surface
- Wait around 1 to 3 days for the paper to dry
  - Note that paper thickness, weather temperature, and humidity will affect drying speed
- Once dry, peel the paper off the surface
